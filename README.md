React Native Countries App is a mobile application where you can search and filter all the countries in the world.

It uses the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to get a lot of data about the different countries, like the population, the flag, the border countries and many others.

### Use

1. Install the dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

2. Start the expo app.

```sh
npm start
```

3. Scan the QR Code with your mobile or start a Simulator.

4. If you don't have Expo Go on your smartphone, download it.

And voil√† !
